## Description

**Secure Inbox** represents a step in the ongoing effort to combat phishing by exploring the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into email security. This browser extension aims to demonstrate how AI can contribute to safeguarding users from deceptive email content and potentially malicious attachments

## Features

While Secure Inbox is not functional for end-users, it showcases potential features that could enhance email security, including:

- Email content analysis for potential phishing threats.
- Real-time feedback on the safety of an email.
- Detection and warning about malicious hyperlinks and attachments.
- Sentiment analysis of email content.
- Support for popular email services, including Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, iCloud Mail, and AOL Mail.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes:

- Backend (Flask-based) for email analysis and data storage.
- Frontend (JavaScript-based) for interacting with email content.
- Integration with external services like VirusTotal and OpenAI.
- A manifest file for browser extension configuration.

## Undergraduate Thesis

Secure Inbox represents a significant milestone in my undergraduate thesis, which delves into the field of email security. The core focus of the thesis was to gain insights into the reasons behind the susceptibility of individuals, particularly in workplace settings, to phishing attacks.

Phishing remains a persistent and evolving threat, often exploiting human vulnerabilities. The study sought to uncover the underlying factors contributing to this susceptibility, including user behavior, awareness, and the sophistication of phishing techniques.

The Secure Inbox browser extension emerged as a proactive response to the findings of this study. It's an endeavor to explore potential solutions to this pressing cybersecurity concern. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and external services, the extension aims to assist users in identifying and mitigating phishing threats more effectively.

Through this project, I hope to shed light on innovative ways to bolster email security and empower individuals to make informed decisions when interacting with their email messages. While this extension is not a comprehensive solution, it represents a step towards enhancing our collective defenses against phishing attacks.
